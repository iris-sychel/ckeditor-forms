Installation
------------

The CKEditor form control is packaged as a single JAR file for easy installation into Alfresco Share.

To install the control:

  1. Drop the `ckeditor-form-control-<version>.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation
  2.  Update your form configuration files. You can use the [sample configuration](ckeditor-config-custom.xml.sample) file by removing the `.sample` extension and placing it in `tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/web-extension`. This may override other changes you have made for forms, so use with caution. Alternatively, follow the [manual configuration](#manual-configuration) steps below.
  3. Restart the application server.

### Manual Configuration

This is required only if you are _not_ using the sample configuration in `ckeditor-config-custom.xml.sample`.

#### Forms Configuration

In you forms configuration file, under apperance, add

    <appearance>
       <field id="cm:content">
          <control template="/org/alfresco/components/form/controls/ckeditor.ftl">
             <control-param name="forceEditor">true</control-param>
          </control>
       </field>
    </appearance>

To load a custom JavaScript based file use

    <appearance>
       <field id="cm:content">
          <control template="/org/alfresco/components/form/controls/ckeditor.ftl">
             <control-param name="forceEditor">true</control-param>
             <control-param name="settingsfile">components/editors/ckeditor/my-config.js</control-param>
          </control>
       </field>
    </appearance>

Path to custom settings file should not have a starting /. More information on how to create custom configuration files can be found in http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide.
Use the http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/CKEditor%20Form%20Control/source/web/components/editors/ckeditor/config.js as a template.

#### Loading Forms Dependencies

The `ckeditor-form-control.jar` includes configuration to load javascript [dependencies](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Forms#dependencies). However if you have other configuration in a custom config file this may overwrite this configuration. __Only do this step if CKEditor fails to load.__

    <config>
        <forms>
	        <dependencies>
               <!-- Include some extra assets --> 
               <js src="/modules/editors/ckeditor/ckeditor.js" />
               <js src="/components/editors/ckeditor/ckeditorloader.js" />
            </dependencies>
        </forms>
    </config>

If you notice that the above JavaScript files do not load when creating or editing an HTML file, merge this configuration to your `share-config-custom.xml` file. Indication that this is happening is that the textarea is blank and the editor has failed to load.
  
Building from Source
---------------------

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run Ant from the base project directory.

    ant dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file named `ckeditor-form-control.jar` in the `build/dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar` task and set the `tomcat.home` property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat hotcopy-tomcat-jar
    
After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

Usage
-----

The control should appear when you create a new HTML file, or edit an existing HTML file online.

To insert images from a Share site, select the images button, and then _Browse Server_.
